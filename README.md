# Figma to HTML/CSS/JS

This project is based on a provided Figma design that I got from my friend for practice purposes. The goal is to replicate the Figma design and make it responsive for all screen sizes.

The website is created with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with no use of any framework.
Google fonts are stored locally in this project - no CDN used.
In the head tag of the HTML, I used all necessary meta tags for the best SEO score.
I used a desktop-first approach, as the main target for this website should be companies and potential clients. We assume that they would use a laptop/desktop for browsing this page mostly.
On the images below, you can see the desktop and mobile versions.
